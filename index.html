        it is such an amazing thing to love someone and be loved back in return. but when it doesnt go that way, you cannot come and kill yourself.I love you not just because of how you make me feel, not just because you make me safe, not just because i know you can protect me, and definalety not because you love and care about me.I love you because it is what i want to do and nothing is going to change that, nothing!(forget the exclamation mark, i'm not shouting. lol)

    he's got an amazing heart.The just cannot afford not making a positive impact in your life. you deserve every good thing that life has got to offer. dont stop beleiving in what you believe in.The world is waiting for you to catch them. They have been on the fall for a very long time.there are so many people aiting at that same very door. It is time for your breakthroug, quit waiting for open doors. If life gives you lemon, make lemonade, bake some cakes and break a leg. If you were to be the president of Nigeria for a day, what would be the first thing you will do. The Love of God constrains me.
